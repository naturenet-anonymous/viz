        <p>The Community-Driven Environmental Projects  (C-DEP) model is a multi-university research endeavor funded by the NSF AISL program with an objective to engage members of diverse communities in local nature and environmental conservation projects of their choosing.
Our approach is to adapt and design new features of NatureNet (NN), an existing multi-touch technology platform that uses mobile devices and a website to enable participants to develop and carry out projects that support their own informal learning and foster positive scientific dispositions.
The goal of this site is to share our findings throughout the project with relation to engagement, user trajectories, and learning outcomes of our participants. </p>
        <p>Join our community and contribute to science through our <a href="https://nature-net.org/">website</a>.</p>
